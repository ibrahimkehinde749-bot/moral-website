  <figcaption style="text-align:center; font-size:0.9rem; color:#666; margin-top:6px;">The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was officially established on May 4, 1980, following the Department of Education Organization Act of 1979, which separated the education functions from the former Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. As the federal government‚Äôs primary agency for health care and social welfare services, HHS operated through eleven divisions in fiscal year 2002, employing approximately 65,000 people and managing a budget of $460 billion. Its major responsibilities included administering the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program‚Äîa joint state-federal welfare initiative that replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program‚Äîas well as overseeing the Medicare and Medicaid health care programs, which served nearly one in four Americans. </figcaption>
<p>Grant Program Highlights:
Administration for Children & Families (ACF);
The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) promotes the economic and social well-being of families, children, individuals, and communities. ACF programs are designed to empower families and individuals to increase their independence and productivity; foster strong, healthy, and supportive communities that enhance quality of life and promote positive child development; and build partnerships with frontline service providers, states, local governments, and tribal communities to improve access to services through effective planning, reform, and integration. In addition, ACF addresses the unique needs, strengths, and capabilities of vulnerable populations, including individuals with developmental disabilities, refugees, and migrants. </p>
<p>Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)
The mission of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is to generate evidence that improves the safety, quality, accessibility, equity, and affordability of health care. AHRQ works within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and collaborates with various partners to ensure that this evidence is effectively communicated and applied in practice. Through its grant programs, AHRQ supports research aimed at enhancing the quality, effectiveness, accessibility, and cost-efficiency of health care services.</p>
<p>National Institutes of Health (NIH)
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) provides financial support through grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts to advance its mission of enhancing health, extending healthy lives, and reducing the burdens of illness and disability. While many NIH grants focus on research, the agency also offers funding opportunities in areas such as fellowships and training, career development, scientific conferences, resource development, and facility construction.</p>
